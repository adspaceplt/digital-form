-- ===========================================================================
-- DRAFTS THE TEAM SENT BACK STAY WITH THE TEAM — a campaign's link rules
-- only on a draft that is with the client. 2026-10-17. Safe to run twice.
-- Rollback at the foot. Mirrored byte for byte in supabase/schema.sql under
-- the same banner; tests/sql.js compares the two.
--
-- WHAT CHANGED (the security audit of 2026-10-16, finding B)
--   1. `review_draft` (anon, the campaign's key) took a decision on any
--      booking at Changes requested, including one the team sent back to
--      the creator (`campaign_send_back`, changes_by team), which the
--      selection page shows as Pending draft. A call made by hand could
--      approve a draft the team had refused, moving it to Scheduled. It now
--      answers `not-reviewing` for that case; a client's own request for
--      changes is still theirs to change, as before.
--
-- ROLLBACK
--   Run `review_draft` again from
--   2026-09-19-client-decision-record-and-creator-rating.sql.
