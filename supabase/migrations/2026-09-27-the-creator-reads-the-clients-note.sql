-- ===========================================================================
-- THE CREATOR READS THE CLIENT'S NOTE — a request for changes made on the
-- client's page reaches the creator who has to act on it.
-- 2026-09-27. Safe to run twice. Rollback at the foot. Mirrored byte for byte
-- in supabase/schema.sql under the same banner; tests/sql.js compares the two.
--
-- The client's Request changes files its note in `option_reviews`
-- (`review_draft`); `get_creator` read the note from `drop_reason`, which only
-- the team's own send-back fills, so the creator's page said "Please revise
-- as noted below" over nothing (reported by the user, 2026-09-27, with three
-- such requests on record). The note now comes from the client's latest
-- request where the round is theirs, and from `drop_reason` where the team
-- sent it back.
--
-- ROLLBACK
--   Re-run get_creator from its canonical section above.
