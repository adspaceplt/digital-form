-- ===========================================================================
-- COMPLETED CAMPAIGNS STAY READABLE — a completed campaign's selection link
-- keeps showing its results after the client moves to Past. 2026-10-18.
-- Safe to run twice. Rollback at the foot. Mirrored byte for byte in
-- supabase/schema.sql under the same banner; tests/confirmonce.js compares
-- the two.
--
-- WHAT CHANGED (the user, 2026-10-18: "creator selection, once completed
-- the results not even viewed then the link no longer works"; 988)
--   get_campaign answers a Past client's campaign once it is Completed, read
--   only: `selection_closed` true and `backups_open` false, so the page
--   offers nothing to choose. Any other campaign of a Past client still
--   answers `not-found`, and save_selection, confirm_selection,
--   confirm_selection_with and review_draft still refuse every Past client
--   (PAST CLIENT LINKS ACT ON NOTHING), so nothing on the link writes.
--   media-pass and sign-download ask get_campaign, so the files and the
--   invoice open with it. Restated whole from PASSCODE LOCKS PER CALLER with
--   only that changed.
--
-- ROLLBACK
--   Run get_campaign from PASSCODE LOCKS PER CALLER again
--   (2026-10-18-passcode-locks-per-caller.sql).
