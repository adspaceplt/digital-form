-- ==========================================================================
-- THE AUTOMATIC SERIAL FILLS THE GAP A DELETION LEFT
-- 2026-09-20. Safe to run twice. Rollback at the foot.
--
-- `serial_taken()` stopped counting deletions earlier today, and a reference
-- freed that way could be put back into use — but only by typing it. The
-- automatic path still read the per-client, per-month counter and used its
-- value outright, so a client whose first two letters were issued in testing
-- and deleted went on starting at 03, which is the complaint that began this.
--
-- `issue_letter` now builds the number from the LOWEST FREE SLOT in that
-- client and month rather than from the counter's own value. The counter is
-- kept and still advances, for one reason: its upsert takes a row lock, so a
-- second issuer blocks there until the first has committed its letter and the
-- two can never read the same gap as free. It is the bound the scan runs
-- within, not the number.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHANGED
--   * A typed reference still spends no sequence number and is still refused
--     where a standing document holds it.
--   * `serial_taken()` is untouched: a reference is spent by a document that
--     STANDS, and a voided, superseded or refused letter still holds its own.
--     Only a deletion frees one, which is the rule the user asked for.
--   * Nothing renumbers a letter already issued.
--
-- THE COST, STATED
--   The counter stops meaning "how many letters this client was issued this
--   month" and becomes the bound on the search. Where somebody has typed
--   references by hand over the same range the scan can run past it; it is
--   capped and refuses (`no-serial`) rather than looping.
